# Backstory
You are a developer at EnergyCom, an electricity company that manages thousands of electricity meters across multiple countries. You’ve taken over a codebase left behind by a developer who didn’t finish the project before leaving, and we’d like you to finish what they started. The application ingests data from several different sources, and when run right now simply makes that data available, but doesn’t do anything with it. 

## Your task
Your job is to expand the application such that the data can be organized and presented in a way where it is possible to reliably answer:

- How much electricity is produced by our devices?
- What kinds of devices do we run, and where?
- Any other information you find pertinent to the data you have available.

As this needs to be done urgently, you will only have at most 4 hours to build something that is useful. Your priority should be functionality and impact, so while information clarity is important, visual aesthetics and shine are not. EnergyCom is aware that this isn’t much time, so you’ll be expected to prioritize your time on the things you find important, to reason about why you’ve made the choices you have, and to have a plan for further work than what you can do in those 4 hours. 

### Requirements
- You should spend no more than 4 hours on this programming assignment.
- If you make changes to what is required to run the application in any way, you must ensure this README.md is updated under the Setup section. If we cannot run your solution it is likely an automatic failure.
- You are required to use git as you work on the project.
- We will be checking the git commit history in terms of both content and the commit message.
- You are encouraged to document your reasoning, priorities and general thoughts as you go along, in the THOUGHTS.MD markdown file.
- You may not change the applications that create the data in any way, at all - consider them ‘black boxes’ that simply create data. What you do with that data from that point on is 100% up to you, whether you want to stuff it in memory, in a database, in a file or whatever you’d like.
